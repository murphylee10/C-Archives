# C-Archives

Some of my past projects in C! Here's a breakdown:

File Submission Clone - A large-scale server which can accept multiple files from various clients concurrently (forking is used for concurrency). An example client program is added as a demo.

Piping From Scratch - Emulates piping in Bash, taking in n commands, and using Forking, Redirection, and Exec to execute each command sequentially.

Sorting Files - Emulates the behavior of "sort" in Bash, using File I/O in C, and sorting with the Heapsort algorithm, which leads to ~10% improved runtime (compared to merge-sort used in Bash).
